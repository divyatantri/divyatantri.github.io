    "The dashboard we have created here shows the losses with respect to equipment ranging from: aircraft, helicopter, tank, APC, field artillery, MRL, military auto, fuel tank, drone, naval ship, anti-aircraft warfare, special equipment, mobile SRBM system for the day of the week and shows what the day it is on the y axis. We have created a heatmap to show the day of the week and the days of the war. The dashboard also has the capability to populate a bar chart for the number of equipment loss when a portion of the heatmap is selected. This is part of our interactivity in the dashboard. Additionally, the heatmap also drives another plot that shows the cummulative personnel losses vs the equipment losses till the day selected."

    "As mentioned in part 2 of the project, we have further analysed a twitter dataset consisting tweets related to the on going conflict. On Kaggle, we discovered this fascinating dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-million-rows This collection contains daily Twitter datasets related to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict. The information includes whether a tweet was retweeted or not, as well as people's views on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It can also assist us in gathering information from trustworthy or government sources. We have included two visualizations for this dataset that visualize the top languages in which the tweets have been made and top locations where the Russia-Ukraine is most discussed about on twitter.

    "One of the major difficulties we faced was dealing with the twitter data. The dataset file consisted of multiple compresse csvs. It was an interesting challenge to figure out how to combine this in a single dataframe. Due to the magnitude of the data, the compilation time for just importing the data was almost 40 minutes. Hence, the team decided to drop unnecessary columns that reduced the size of the data set. We exported this dataset and visualized the clean data."

    "Russia may have lost 25% of its original assault force in four weeks of warfare. These losses are not on the magnitude of World War II, but they are significant when compared to the Russian military's current strength. Although reinforcements and replacements can help to offset some of these losses, the loss of trained personnel will impede military operations and have a political impact. The dashboard indicates how losses have mount up on the Russian side as the war proceeded. This dashboard lets the user segregate the russian losses equipment wise as well as stats on loss of personelle. "
