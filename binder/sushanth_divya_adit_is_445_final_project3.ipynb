It was an interesting challenge to figure out how to combine this in a single dataframe. Due to the magnitude of the data, the compilation time for just importing the data was almost 40 minutes. Hence, the team decided to drop unnecessary columns that reduced the size of the data set. We exported this dataset and visualized the clean data."
